A timeline visualizes events chronologically, making it easier to understand project progress, historical sequences, or future plans. Whether you're tracking project milestones, creating a presentation, or documenting company history, you need the right tool to build your timeline.

This guide shows you how to create timelines using tools you likely already have:

- [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel): Using SmartArt for basic document timelines.
- [Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word): Using SmartArt for report and document timelines.
- [PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint): Using SmartArt for presentation timelines.
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)/[Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/): Using Timeline view for collaborative projects (requires [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/)).
- [Preceden](https://www.preceden.com): Using dedicated timeline software for professional results.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): Using [Bryntum](https://bryntum.com/) to build custom timeline charts.

Each section is self-contained, so you can jump directly to the tool you want to use. Before diving into the how-to sections, you'll learn the key differences between timelines and Gantt charts to choose the proper visualization for your needs.

## What Are the Differences Between a Timeline and a Gantt? 

Timelines and Gantt charts both visualize events over time, but they serve different purposes. Understanding the difference helps you choose the right tool for your project.

### What's a Timeline? 

A timeline is a linear visualization that shows events in chronological order.

![Timeline example](/img/comparisons/how-to-create-timeline/timeline-example.png)

Timelines focus on dates and milestones, making them ideal for:

- Historical events such as company founding, product launches, and industry evolution.
- Project milestones like major deadlines and deliverables.
- Event planning, like conference agendas.

A timeline answers the question: **What happened when?**

### What's a Gantt Chart? 

A Gantt chart shows when events happen, how long they take, and how they relate to each other.

![Gantt chart example](/img/comparisons/how-to-create-timeline/gantt-chart-example.png)

Gantt charts display:

- Task start and end dates.
- Task duration.
- Overlapping tasks.
- Task dependencies – which tasks must finish before others can start.

A Gantt chart answers the questions: **When does this happen, how long does it take, and what depends on it?**

### Timeline vs Gantt Chart: Which One Should You Use?

Choose a **timeline** when you want to communicate a sequence of events to an audience. Timelines work best for presentations, reports, and documentation where clarity matters more than detailed project management.

Choose a **Gantt chart** when you need to plan and track complex projects with multiple tasks, dependencies, and resources. Gantt charts work best for project managers coordinating teams and deliverables.

## How to Create a Timeline in Excel?

[Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) doesn't have a dedicated timeline chart. You can create a basic timeline using [SmartArt](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-smartart-graphic-from-scratch-fac94c93-500b-4a0a-97af-124040594842) graphics, which work in Excel desktop applications but not in [Excel Online](https://www.microsoft365.com/launch/excel).

### Step 1: Insert SmartArt

On the Excel application, follow these steps: 

1. Go to the Insert tab.
2. Select the SmartArt option.
3. Then select "Process". You will see many options to describe a process, a timeline. 
4. Choose the one that works for you, but for this tutorial, we will use the first one, "Basic process".

## How to Create a Timeline in Google Docs

[Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) doesn't have a built-in timeline feature. You can create a timeline in [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) using Timeline view, then add it to your document as an image.

> **Note**: Timeline view is only available for [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) accounts (Business Starter, Business Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise, Education editions). Free Google accounts do not have access to this feature.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data in Google Sheets

Create a new Google Sheet and set up your timeline data in columns:

```
Card Title,Start Date,End Date,Card Detail
Research & Planning,1/15/2025,2/1/2025,Initial research phase
Design Phase,2/15/2025,3/15/2025,UI/UX design
Development,4/15/2025,6/15/2025,Build features
Testing,6/15/2025,7/1/2025,QA and bug fixes
Launch,7/15/2025,7/15/2025,Product launch
```

![Google Sheets data setup](/img/comparisons/how-to-create-timeline/google-sheets-data-setup.png)

Enter your dates in a standard format like 1/15/2025 or 01/15/2025. Google Sheets recognizes these as dates automatically and right-aligns them in the cells.

### Step 2: Insert Timeline View

In your Google Sheet, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Insert menu.
2. Click Timeline.

![Google Sheets insert timeline menu](/img/comparisons/how-to-create-timeline/google-sheets-insert-timeline-menu.png)

3. Select your data range, including all columns with headers.

   ![Google Sheets select data range](/img/comparisons/how-to-create-timeline/google-sheets-select-data-range.png)

4. Click Ok after validating the selection.

Google Sheets creates an interactive timeline view showing your tasks as cards on a horizontal timeline.

![Google Sheets timeline result](/img/comparisons/how-to-create-timeline/google-sheets-timeline-result.png)

On the right panel, you can customize the timeline by modifying the card title, the card color, or the display. 

### Step 4: Embed in Google Docs

Google Docs doesn't support embedding timelines directly from Google Sheets. To add your timeline to a document:

1. In Google Sheets, click File -> Download -> PDF Document.
2. Convert the PDF to an image using a tool like [pdf2png.com](https://pdf2png.com) or [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/).
3. In Google Docs, click Insert -> Image -> Upload from computer.
4. Select your converted timeline image.

## How to Create a Timeline in JavaScript

Creating timelines in web applications requires a [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library that handles rendering, interactivity, and data management. While you could build a timeline from scratch using [HTML canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) or [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG), production-quality timelines need features like drag-and-drop, zoom controls, and responsive design.

For this guide, you will learn how to create a timeline using the [Bryntum Scheduler Pro](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler-pro/) component, which has easy setup and provides complete timeline functionality. [Bryntum](https://bryntum.com/) offers trial packages so you can test the library before purchasing. If you're interested in other JavaScript timeline options, you can also check [vis-timeline](https://visjs.github.io/vis-timeline/docs/timeline/) (open source) and [Timeline.js](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) (free for storytelling timelines).

### Prerequisites

Before creating your timeline, you need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed on your computer.
- A [Bryntum](https://bryntum.com/) account (free trial available).

### Step 1: Initialize your project

Create a new project directory and initialize an npm project:

```bash
mkdir timeline-project
cd timeline-project
npm init -y
```

### Step 2: Set up npm authentication

Bryntum packages require authentication. Follow the [npm repository login guide](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/docs/guide/Scheduler/npm-repository#login) to authenticate your npm client.

Then configure npm to access Bryntum packages by following the [npm configuration guide](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/docs/guide/Scheduler/npm-repository#configure-npm).

### Step 3: Install Bryntum Scheduler

Install Bryntum Scheduler. You can use the trial version or purchase a license. Follow the [installation guide](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/docs/guide/Scheduler/npm-repository#installing-trial-packages) for your chosen version.

For the trial version:

```bash
npm install @bryntum/scheduler@npm:@bryntum/scheduler-trial@6.3.3
```

### Step 4: Create your HTML file

Inside the project directory, create an `index.html` file with the timeline container:

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Timeline Chart</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@bryntum/scheduler/scheduler.stockholm.css">
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;
            margin: 20px;
            background: #f5f5f5;
        }
        #timeline-container {
            height: 500px;
            background: white;
            border-radius: 8px;
            box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="timeline-container"></div>
    <script type="module" src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 5: Create your JavaScript timeline

Create an `app,js` file with the following timeline configuration: 

```js
import { Scheduler, DateHelper } from './node_modules/@bryntum/scheduler/scheduler.module.js';

// Define your timeline events
const events = [
    {
        id: 1,
        name: 'Research & Planning',
        startDate: new Date(2025, 0, 15),
        endDate: new Date(2025, 1, 1),
        resourceId: 1
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        name: 'Design Phase',
        startDate: new Date(2025, 1, 15),
        endDate: new Date(2025, 2, 15),
        resourceId: 1
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        name: 'Development',
        startDate: new Date(2025, 3, 15),
        endDate: new Date(2025, 5, 15),
        resourceId: 1
    },
    {
        id: 4,
        name: 'Testing',
        startDate: new Date(2025, 5, 15),
        endDate: new Date(2025, 6, 1),
        resourceId: 1
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        name: 'Launch',
        startDate: new Date(2025, 6, 15),
        endDate: new Date(2025, 6, 15),
        resourceId: 1
    }
];

// Create a single resource (timeline row)
const resources = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Project Timeline' }
];

// Initialize the timeline
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    appendTo: 'timeline-container',
    resources: resources,
    events: events,
    startDate: new Date(2025, 0, 1),
    endDate: new Date(2025, 7, 1),
    viewPreset: 'weekAndMonth',
    columns: [
        { text: 'Timeline', field: 'name', width: 150 }
    ],
    features: {
        eventDrag: true,
        eventResize: true,
        eventEdit: true,
        eventTooltip: true
    },
    rowHeight: 60,
    barMargin: 10
});
```

### Step 6: Run your timeline

Open `index.html` in a web browser. 

![Bryntum timeline result](/img/comparisons/how-to-create-timeline/bryntum-timeline-result.png)

You'll see an interactive timeline where you can:

- Drag events to change their dates.
- Resize events to adjust duration.
- Click events to edit details.
- Hover over events to see tooltips.

## Conclusion

This guide showed you how to create timelines in [Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel), [Word](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word), [PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint), [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/), [Preceden](https://www.preceden.com), and JavaScript using [Bryntum Scheduler Pro](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler-pro/).

[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) and [Preceden](https://www.preceden.com) offer the best experience because they use your spreadsheet data directly and let you easily customize colors. Microsoft tools use [SmartArt](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/create-a-smartart-graphic-from-scratch-fac94c93-500b-4a0a-97af-124040594842), which is simple to use but requires manual updates for each event.

For occasional timelines in documents or presentations, SmartArt works fine. For professional timelines with many events or frequent updates, use Preceden. And if you're a developer building a dashboard or tool that needs embedded timelines, use [Bryntum Scheduler Pro](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler-pro/) for complete control over appearance and functionality.
